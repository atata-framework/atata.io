**Atata Framework** - C#/.NET web test automation full-featured framework based on Selenium WebDriver.
It uses a fluent page object pattern;
has a built-in logging system;
contains a unique triggers functionality;
has a set of ready-to-use components.
One of the key ideas of the framework is to provide a simple and intuitive syntax for defining and using page objects.
A page object implementation requires as less code as possible.
You can describe a page object class without any methods and only have a set of properties marked with attributes representing page components.

The framework is completely open source and hosted on GitHub as
[Atata Framework organization]({{ site.links.atata_github_organization }}) under the Apache License 2.0.
All framework libraries are published and available as NuGet packages.
