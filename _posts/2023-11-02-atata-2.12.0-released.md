## New `On` and `OnOrTo` navigation methods

The new methods were added to `Go` and `AtataNavigator` classes:

```cs
public T On<T>()
    where T : PageObject<T>;
```

Continues with the specified page object type.
Firstly, checks whether the current `AtataContext.PageObject`
is `T`, if it is, returns it; otherwise, creates a new instance of `T` without navigation.
The method is useful in case when in a particular step method (BDD step, for example)
you don't have an instance of current page object but you are sure that a browser is on the needed page.

```cs
public T OnOrTo<T>()
    where T : PageObject<T>;
```

Continues with the specified page object type or navigates to it.

is `T`, if it is, returns it; otherwise, creates a new instance of `T` with navigation.

### Usage

AtataContext.Current.Go.On<SomePage>();
