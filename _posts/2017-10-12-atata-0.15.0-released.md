## .NET Core Support

.NET Standard 2.0 version of Atata added with v0.15.0.
Now you can use Atata package in .NET Core 2.0 test project.
You can also create .NET Standard 2.0 library project for Atata components package.

### WebDriver .NET Core Issues

There is a bug in Selenium WebDriver v3.6.0 for .NET Core 2.0: each WebDriver request takes extra 1 second. It makes execution of WebDriver actions very slow.
The fix is added within Atata package.
Use `WithFixOfCommandExecutionDelay` driver configurational method to get round of this bug.
Check the fix details: {% include issue.md id=101 %} **Fix command execution delay of WebDriver for .NET Core 2.0**.
{:.warning}

WebDriver doesn't look for driver (e.g., "chromedriver.exe") in local folder in .NET Standard 2.0 version.
Use `WithLocalDriverPath` driver configurational method if you use .NET Core 2.0 project that uses driver as a project package (hosted in the same build directory).
Check the fix details: {% include issue.md id=102 %} **Add WithLocalDriverPath method to DriverAtataContextBuilder<TBuilder, TService, TOptions>**.
{:.warning}

### NUnit .NET Core Issues

Current {% include nuget.md name='NUnit3TestAdapter' %} package v3.8.0 doesn't support parallel test execution yet.
{:.warning}

Current {% include nuget.md name='NUnit' %} package v3.8.1 doesn't support `SetCulture` and `SetUICulture` attributes.
Please check {% include issue.md id=103 %} for **Culture configuration** using `UseCulture` configurational method.
{:.warning}

### Running Tests with Visual Studio

For test detection in "Test Explorer" VS panel, .NET Core requires {% include nuget.md name='Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk' %} package to be added to the project containing tests (no matter NUnit, xUnit, MSTest, etc.).
{:.warning}

## Wait Method

Added new method to `UIComponent<TOwner>`:

```cs
public TOwner Wait(Until until, WaitOptions options = null);
```

### Usage

```cs
ContentBlock.Wait(Until.Visible);
```

## WaitForAttribute Trigger

Added new `WaitForAttribute` trigger with the following constructor:

```cs
public WaitForAttribute(Until until = Until.Visible, TriggerEvents on = TriggerEvents.Init, TriggerPriority priority = TriggerPriority.Medium);
```

It calls component's `Wait` method passing `Until` value to it.

### Usage

```cs
// Wait upon page oject initialization until the control is visible.
[WaitFor]
public Text<_> ContentBlock { get; private set; }

// Wait upon page oject de-initialization until the control is missing or hidden.
[WaitFor(Until.MissingOrHidden, TriggerEvents.DeInit)]
public Text<_> SavingIndicator { get; private set; }
```

## StaleElementReferenceException Handling

Added handling of `StaleElementReferenceException` to `WaitForElementAttribute` trigger and verification methods. Basically, when `StaleElementReferenceException` occurs, Atata catches it and retries an action again.
