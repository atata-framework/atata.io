## Browser logs monitoring functionality

Browser logs monitoring feature now supports remote Chrome and Edge via `RemoteWebDriver`, for example for Selenium Grid.

### Example of configuration

```cs
AtataContext.GlobalConfiguration
    .UseRemoteDriver()
        .WithRemoteAddress("http://localhost:4444/")
        .WithOptions<ChromeOptions>()
    .BrowserLogs.UseLog()
    .BrowserLogs.UseMinLevelOfWarning(LogLevel.Warn);
```

## New control list extension methods

The new `SkipWhile` and `TakeWhile` extension methods are added for `IObjectProvider<IEnumerable<TSource>>`
including `ControlList<TItem, TOwner>`.

```cs
page.SomeTable.Rows.SkipWhile(x => x.SomeValue < 10).ForEach(x => x...);
page.SomeTable.Rows.TakeWhile(x => x.SomeValue < 10).ForEach(x => x...);
```

## Deprecate `Exist` verification extension method

The `BePresent` method should be used instead of `Exist` verification extension method.
The both methods are equivalent and were living for too long, but only one should remain.
`Exist` will be removed in Atata v3.

`SomeControl.Should.Exist();` -> `SomeControl.Should.BePresent();`.

## Exceptions change

Due to upgrade of Atata.WebDriverExtras package to v2.3.0 there are exception types change.

So now:

- When component's element is not found, new `ElementNotFoundException` is thrown instead of `NoSuchElementException`.
- When component expected to be missing but it exists, `ElementNotMissingException` is thrown instead of `NotMissingElementException`.
