## UIComponent&lt;TOwner&gt;.Attributes Property Is Replaced With DomAttributes, DomProperties and DomClasses

Old Atata `UIComponent<TOwner>.Attributes` property under the hood uses `IWebElement.GetAttribute(string)` method of WebDriver.
In WebDriver 4 two new methods were introduced: `IWebElement.GetDomAttribute(string)` and `IWebElement.GetDomProperty(string)`.
Their functionality is similar but differs,
check out [Selenium 4 - Element Attribute and Property Methods](https://saucelabs.com/resources/articles/selenium-4-new-element-attribute-and-property-methods) for example.
Now it is recommended to use new methods instead of `GetAttribute`.

So it was decided to reflect the same enhancement in Atata.
Old `UIComponent<TOwner>.Attributes` property is marked as obsolete.
Mostly you'll need to use `DomProperties` instead, `DomClasses` for querying classes, and `DomAttributes` to get `data-*` attributes.

See new properties corresponding issues for details:
- [#682](https://github.com/atata-framework/atata/issues/682) Add `DomAttributes` property to `UIComponent<TOwner>`
- [#682](https://github.com/atata-framework/atata/issues/683) Add `DomProperties` property to `UIComponent<TOwner>`
- [#682](https://github.com/atata-framework/atata/issues/684) Add `DomClasses` property to `UIComponent<TOwner>`

## New Verification Methods

### ConsistOfSingle

Verifies that collection consists of a single item and the item matches the `predicateExpression`.

```cs
new[] { 1 }.ToSutSubject()
    .Should.ConsistOfSingle(x => x == 1);
```

### ConsistSequentiallyOf

Verifies that collection consists sequentially of items that match one by one the `predicateExpressions`.

```cs
new[] { 1, 2 }.ToSutSubject()
    .Should.ConsistSequentiallyOf(x => x == 1, x => x == 2);
```
