## Changelog

### Changed

- {% include issue.md id=844 type='mj' %} Upgrade Selenium.WebDriver package reference to v4.26.1

## Summary

This is a minor update of Atata with just an upgrade of Selenium.WebDriver package reference from v4.23.0 to v4.26.1.
Take a look at [Selenium.WebDriver CHANGELOG](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/dotnet/CHANGELOG)
to find out what was changed there.
One of significant WebDriver changes is migration from Newtonsoft.Json to System.Text.Json package.
The other new big thing in WebDriver is BiDi implementation.

Once again, no new features in this Atata release.
Many new things are coming to Atata and are currently in development,
but they are planned for future Atata v4, as there are breaking changes.
Stay tuned.
