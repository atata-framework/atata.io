## Summary

This is a minor update of Atata with an upgrade of Selenium.WebDriver package reference from v4.28.0 to v4.31.0.
Take a look at [Selenium.WebDriver CHANGELOG](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/dotnet/CHANGELOG)
to find out what was changed there.
Additionally, nullable reference types were enabled in the latest v3.2.0 of Atata.WebDriverExtras.
Expect Atata v4 to also have nullable reference types enabled in the future.

Once again, no new features in this Atata release.
Many new things are coming to Atata and are currently in development,
but they are planned for future Atata v4, as there are breaking changes.
Stay tuned.
