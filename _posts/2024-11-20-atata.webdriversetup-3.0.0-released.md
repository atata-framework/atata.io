## Changelog

### Added

- Add predefined map of Edge version/drivers.
- Add remote map of Edge version/drivers.

## Summary

This release exclusively brings an improvement to Edge driver setup.
Edge driver setup process was the least reliable due to not simple browser/driver versions correspondence.
So a predefined map of Edge version/drivers was added to the library itself.
Additionally a remote map was added for cases when the predefined map doesn't contain newer version information.

## Breaking changes

The version was increased from 2.14.0 to 3.0.0 because there were changes in public interfaces:
`IDriverSetupStrategy`, `IGetsDriverClosestVersion`, `IGetsDriverVersionCorrespondingToBrowserVersion`.
But as these interfaces are not a part of publicly documented API and 99% not used directly by anyone,
the upgrade to v3.0.0 should not bring breaking changes.
If you use these interfaces for custom driver setup strategy, the changes should be easy to follow.
If having upgrade problems, contact me.
