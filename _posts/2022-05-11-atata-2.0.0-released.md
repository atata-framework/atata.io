## Artifacts

`AtataContext.Artifacts` became a default root directory path for log files, screenshots and other files.
Now you can configure in one place common `Artifacts` path for all test output files.

The default `Artifacts` path template is `"{basedir}/artifacts/{build-start:yyyyMMddTHHmmss}{test-suite-name-sanitized:/*}{test-name-sanitized:/*}"`.

## AtataContext Variables

The `IDictionary<string, object> Variables` property is added to `AtataContext`.

The list of predefined variables that are present in `Variables`:
- `build-start`
- `build-start-utc`
- `basedir`
- `artifacts`
- `test-name-sanitized`
- `test-name`
- `test-suite-name-sanitized`
- `test-suite-name`
- `test-start`
- `test-start-utc`
- `driver-alias`

Custom variables can be added as well.

Methods were added to `AtataContextBuilder`:

```cs
public AtataContextBuilder AddVariable(string key, object value);

public AtataContextBuilder AddVariables(IDictionary<string, object> variables);
```

Atata.Configuration.Json v2 also supports variables:

```js
{
  "variables": {
    "anyVariableName": "value" // Any custom variable. Value can be string, number or boolean.
  }
}
```
